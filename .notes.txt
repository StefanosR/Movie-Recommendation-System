How to create the relationships?
-> Read each unique genre from unique_genres then go to sorted_genres.csv and count how many times it is associated with another movie
-> For example if >10 adventure movies also have the action genre property then the adventure -> action relationship is created and is a strong one
-> View personally the sorted_genres list to create the rules of determining when and where a relationship is strong or weak
