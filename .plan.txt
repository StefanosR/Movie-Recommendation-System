Plan for Content Based Filtering Method: 

STEP1:  Isolate unique genres and unique genre combinations into csv files (and sort them)
        We need the unique genres for counting and the combinations for determining the relationships           STATUS: DONE

STEP2:  Count how many times two genres coexist in a row of combinations (in a movie) and determine 
        how strong their relationship is (zero, low, medium, high, very high)                                   STATUS: DONE

STEP3:  Given a specific movie, view its genre, and search for a non viewed by the user movie that has 
        a strong genre relationship with the one given. Return the proposed movie                               STATUS: -

STEP4:  Visualize genre relationships and occurencies for statistical purposes                                  STATUS: -

STEP5:  Find a combination of the above method and demographics if possible                                     STATUS: -
