STEP1:  Isolate unique genres and unique genre combinations into csv files (and sort them)
        We need the unique genres for counting and the combinations for determining the relationships

STEP2:  Count how many times two genres coexist in a row of combinations (in a movie) and determine 
        how strong their relationship is (zero, low, medium, high, very high)

STEP3:  Given a specific movie, view its genre, and search for a non viewed by the user movie that has
