Plan for Content Based Filtering Method: 

STEP1:  Isolate unique genres and unique genre combinations into csv files (and sort them)
        We need the unique genres for counting and the combinations for determining the relationships           STATUS: DONE

STEP2:  Count how many times two genres coexist in a row of combinations (in a movie) and determine 
        how strong their relationship is (zero, low, medium, high, very high)                                   STATUS: DONE

STEP3:  Given a specific movie, view its genre, and search for a non viewed by the user movie that has 
        a strong genre relationship with the one given. Return the proposed movie                               STATUS: IN PROGRESS

STEP4:  Visualize genre relationships and occurencies for statistical purposes                                  STATUS: IN PROGRESS

STEP5:  Find a combination of the above method and demographics if possible                                     STATUS: DROPPED

RELEVANCE RELATIONSHIPS: 18x18 = 324 relationships (max) -> to be stored in csv

1 -> 1  A        2 -> 1  A        3 -> 1  C
1 -> 2  A        2 -> 2          3 -> 2
1 -> 3  D        2 -> 3          3 -> 3 
1 -> 4          2 -> 4          3 -> 4  A
1 -> 5          2 -> 5          3 -> 5
1 -> 6          2 -> 6          3 -> 6
1 -> 7          2 -> 7          3 -> 7
...             ...             ...

How to create the relationships?
-> Read each unique genre from unique_genres then go to sorted_genres.csv and count how many times it is associated with another movie
-> For example if >10 adventure movies also have the action genre property then the adventure -> action relationship is created and is a strong one
-> View personally the sorted_genres list to create the rules of determining when and where a relationship is strong or weak
